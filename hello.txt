hello this is a message from brackets...

Ok. I checked out feature3 branch before writing this. Are we really only on 3?

Sprucing it up with a few Hamilton lyrics:

ELIZA:
Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf

PHILIP:
Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf

ELIZA:
Good! Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf

PHILIP:
Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf

ELIZA:
Sept huit neuf

PHILIP:
Sept huit neuf  

ELIZA:
Sept huit neuf

PHILIP:
Sept huit neuf

ELIZA AND PHILIP:
One two three four five six seven eight nine!

HAMILTON:
My dearest, Angelica
“Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day”
I trust you’ll understand the reference to
Another Scottish tragedy without my having to name the play
They think me Macbeth, and ambition is my folly
I’m a polymath, a pain in the ass, a massive pain
Madison is Banquo, Jefferson’s Macduff
And Birnam Wood is Congress on its way to Dunsinane

HAMILTON & ANGELICA:
And there you are, an ocean away
Do you have to live an ocean away?
Thoughts of you subside
Then I get another letter
I cannot put the notion away…

ELIZA:
Take a break

HAMILTON:
I am on my way
